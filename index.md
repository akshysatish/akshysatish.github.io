# About Me

I am a **Data Scientist** and **ML Engineer** with experience in working with multi-dimensional datasets to generate actionable insights. My primary interests are in the natural language domain but my focus spans the larger data science landscape. I was first interested in data when I saw a TED talk on data visualization and it mesmerized me. This led me to explore the possibilities presented by data science.

My main projects are:
  - Reducing Hallucinations in LLMs
  - Implementation of a document database from scratch
  - Graph based keyword extraction
