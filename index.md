I am a **Data Scientist** and **ML Engineer**. My primary interests are in the natural language domain but my focus spans the larger data science landscape. My main projects are:
  - Reducing Hallucinations in LLMs
  - Implementation of a document database from scratch
  - Graph based keyword extraction
